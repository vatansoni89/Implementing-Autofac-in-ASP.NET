Autofaq:
  Register Dependency:
    - Add autofaq nuget package to main project so we can register all dependency.
	- Create Container and add dependency to it.
	    For abstract type:
		  var cb = new ContainerBuilder();
          cb.RegisterType<AvengerRepository>().As<IAvengerRepository>();
		For Concrete type:
		  cb.RegisterType<SuperheroService>();
		Build Container:
		  IContainer container = cb.Build();
	- Resolve dependency:
	    Constructor injection resolves autometically as dependency already known to container.
		Concrete dependency resolved like:
		  SuperheroService superheroService = container.Resolve<SuperheroService>();
